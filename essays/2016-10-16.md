## Meteor's Magic

I recently created two web applications: One using J2EE and the other using Meteor. 

The J2EE web app required me to juggle __SQL__, the __Oracle DB__, __GlassFish__, getting the __connection__ to the DB to work, and __getting data__ from the DB to the web application and vice versa.

Meteor on the other hand had already the whole package. All I had to do to start my app was to just run 'meteor run' 
in my app's directory.

When you run that command it also:

1.  Starts up your Web Server
2.  Automatically watches all of your app's files
3.  Auto-refreshes your browser upon seeing a change

What took me ~2 hours to set up on the J2EE web app only took me ~5 minutes to set-up on Meteor. __Ridiculous__

## Saved me time but not my mind

I am not going to lie, when I was first introduced to Meteor I felt like I was looking at ancient hieroglyphics. The different method calls, imports, library methods, and odd parameters threw me in for one hell of a headache which lasted for a couple days. I tried my best to follow what the tutorials but it wasn't clicking for me, I was getting a bit frustrated. 

However, as soon as I started working on more tutorials and building off of their templates I slowly began to see how things
were being pieced together.
