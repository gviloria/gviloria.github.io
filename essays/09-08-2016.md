## Questions Done Right

Programmers always have questions. Knowing how to ask one the "smart way" is a must and yields better results than asking one the 
"not so smart way". 

## So what constitutes the "smart way"?

Well, lets take this question posted to Stack Overflow as an example of ["The Smart Way"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/237104/how-do-i-check-if-an-array-includes-an-object-in-javascript).

What makes that a smart question you ask? Well..

* The post title is concise yet detailed
* Has appropriate tags
* The post is formatted neatly and correctly
* Has good grammar
* Descriptive
* Shows that he has already done it
* Asks how to IMPROVE it rather than how to DO it
* Has searched through similar problems on the forum BEFORE posting

As you can see, the user has already done his part trying to solve the problem. It's also obvious that he has put a lot of effort into making sure his post follows the forum's guidelines, etiquette, and formatting. Because of that, he has been rewarded with many replies, ways to improve his code, upvotes, and even favorites! The community loves his post.

## How to avoid the latter

Now lets take a look at what NOT to do. Ladies and gentleman, this is ["The Not Smart Way"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39380961/using-html-and-javascript-to-perform-calculation).
