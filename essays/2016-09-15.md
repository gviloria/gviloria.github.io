## Benefits of following the standards

I've worked in retail for almost 3 years... and with that, I've developed a pretty bad case of OCD. It's a good and bad thing from my experience; mostly good though! Everytime I code I always make sure that everything lines up perfectly, is indented correctly, and is visually appealing. I basically try my best to follow coding standards. 

I believe it's much easier to learn a programming language if the standards are followed for a couple reasons. First, neat code means that every line could be understood more easily. If the code is messy, I personally feel overwhelmed and lost. Secondly, the code will be much more maintainable because everything is well documented. And lastly, fewer bugs and less time spent!

## The amazing IntelliJ 

I've been using IntelliJ for about a year now and I must say that it is the best! I'm able to customize limitless things. The most important thing for me about IntelliJ is that it detects problems for you and tries to find ways for you to fix it. It even helps you fill in the blanks for functions/methods that you've made as well as the ones found in the respective language's library. The feature I love using the most is the DEBUG feature. When I coded in C, it was really hard to spot errors for my pointers but IntelliJ helped me pinpoint what line(s) were causing the problem. Although I've used it for a year, I don't think I've scratched the surface yet.
