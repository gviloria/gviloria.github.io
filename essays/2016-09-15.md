## Why is it imporant?

With configuration management, working on large projects becomes much more manageable because everything is timestamped,
you'll be able to comment what changes were made, and know who made the change. If something were to go wrong in a project full of thousands of files it'd be troublesome to find which file(s) is the culprit. That's why CM is so important.

## My experience

As a student I've run into many problems due to the lack of of effective configuration management. For example, I had a project that was built up on over the course of 2 months. I never created backups of old versions but instead kept updating the same file. When I messed up, my project already had so many lines of code. It took me 1 week to figure out what went wrong. All of that time wasted could've been avoided if I had just kept track of my project progress.

## Git & Github

Git is popular for configuration management and Github is popular for its software hosting platform. They are both amazing when used together. The two of them make collaborating and sharing files with others easy.
