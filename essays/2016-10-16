## Meteor's Magic!

I recently created two web applications: One using J2EE and the other using Meteor. 

The J2EE web app required me to juggle __SQL__, the __Oracle DB__, __GlassFish__, getting the __connection__ to the DB to work, 
and __getting data__ from the DB to the web application and vice versa.

Meteor on the other hand had the whole package already set. All I had to do to start my app was to just run 'meteor run' 
in my app's directory.

When you run that command it also:
1. Starts up your web server
2. Automatically watches all of your app's files
3. Auto-refreshes your browser upon seeing a change

See that? A __huge__ difference as oppossed to my J2EE web app.
