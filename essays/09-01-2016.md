## Reflection

I honestly grinned upon seeing Javascript code for the first time. So far, I've learned Java, C, and C++. In my opinion, Javascript is so simplified (in a good way). Not having to type out long library methods (Java), function prototypes, and wondering if your pointers went wrong somewhere in your code (C/C++) is the BEST feeling. I now see why Javascript is so popular. 

From a software engineering perspective, Javascript is the Holy Grail. It allows us to build interactive websites, mobile & desktop apps, and is used in game development.

## Athletic Engineering

We had our first in-class WOD today and it was as daunting as I thought it'd be. The practice WOD's given to us beforehand were indeed helpful. Upon being given the task I felt excited, stressed, and nervous at the same time; that was a first.

Since we'll be getting these WOD's every week I decided to give the other Project Euler problems a try. Hopefully, that'll get me in the right mindset. 

I strongly believe that this style of learning will work for me. I want to walk out of this class being confident problem solving skills, so that when interviews come by I'll be ready.
