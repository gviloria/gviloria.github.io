## Art & Programming

   As an artist I honestly can't wait to use programming & art together to its <b>full potential</b> especially when I acquire new skills not only from my Software Engineering class but also my Database Management class. Creating apps of all sorts will probably be one of my newest hobbies. Acquiring and mastering those new skills will take an enormous amount of commitment and hardwork but I'm all for it!
   
   By the end of this semester, I want to be able to use the skills gained from the classes I'm taking and make something I love out of it.

## Work & School

  Last week, I decided to quit my job in sales in order to focus on my studies much more. I worked about 20 hours a week last
semester and it was tough but I was able to pull through. I suffered with bad sleeping habits, constantly got more tired, and
the stress was just unbearable. I do not want to go through that experience ever again. I told myself that this semester will be a lot more different. I'm going to get as involved as I can in the many clubs the campus has to offer, start working on side projects, volunteering, applying for those internships, and most importantly studying hard.
