  I found it quite funny how one of the sample essays were about art. I'm an artist myself and I 
honestly can't wait to use the two (programming & art) together when I acquire new skills from my ICS 314 class. 
Creating apps of all sorts will probably be one of my newest hobbies. However, acquiring and mastering those 
new skills will take an enormous amount of commitment and hardwork but I believe that I'm ready for it.

  I decided to quit my job in sales in order to focus on my studies much more. I worked about 20 hours a week last
semester and it was tough, but I was able to pull through. I suffered with bad sleeping habits and it showed in some of exams.
This semester will be a lot more different. I'm going to get as involved as I can in the many CS clubs the campus has to offer,
start working on side projects, volunteer, and study hard.
