I've always had an interest for Art since I was a child. My dad was the one who inspired me to get into art because he'd always show me 
his drawings back when he was still in college as an architectural student. 
I wanted to do the same! Soon after, I began creating art whenever I got the chance to. 
I always loved and still love sharing my art with my friends and family.

Through art, my love for programming also sparked. I've always appreciated and enjoyed the art design from all the video games I've played
throughout the years. At one point I got so inspired, I wanted to learn how the developers built my favorite video games. I wanted to make
my own game to share with others, and it is still a dream of mine. 

What amazes me is that with art and programming, you can build something absolutely beautiful and amazing...almost out of nothing!
Anyways, I hope you enjoy my art!
