I am part of an organization that made a web application intended for the University of Hawaii at Manoa called LetUmGrow.

LetUmGrow is basically a web application that allows users to learn more about our campus's plants. 

Unfortunately, our application is only usable by students registered for our campus. However, we do plan on making it work outside of our campus in the near future!
